# Portfolio-GitHub
**Hello! This is my personal portfolio where you can explore some of the projects I have participated in.**

Biotechnology Dissertation: In this section, you’ll find projects related to my bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology Engineering. Additionally, I’ve included the code I used for my dissertation research.//

Computational Biology Science Club: During a summer school (science club) in Veracruz, México, I learned the latest techniques and methodologies for analyzing biological data computationally using Python and relevant libraries. Topics covered range from biomolecular interactions to large-scale genetic networks.//

Huawei Machine Learning Certification: I obtained an associate certification in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on Machine Learning from Huawei. You’ll find exercises and implementations related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and LLM algorithms.//

iGEM Competition: As part of the synthetic biology competition, we developed algorithms and models for designing and analyzing biological circuits.//

Master’s Degree: During my master’s degree in complexity sciences, with a focus on nonlinear dynamics, I worked extensively with various algorithms. Projects included tasks like plotting bifurcation diagrams for logistic maps and analyzing large systems of differential equations.//

Feel free to explore and learn more about these exciting projects!
