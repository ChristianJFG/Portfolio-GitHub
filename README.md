# Portfolio-GitHub
**Hello, this is my personal portfolio, here you will find some of the projects I have participated in.**

Image_Analysis:  In this project an algorithm was designed to analyze biological microscope images.//
Maxmin_Driving_Force: In this project a linear optimization algorithm was implemented to analyze data from metabolic networks, entered through a stoichiometric matrix S //
Modelo_final_aut√≥matas: A model was made with the cellular automata theory in order to recreate genetic circuits and analyze their functioning. //
Probabilidad_Frecuentista: Program that calculates the effect of performing multiple random experiments on the convergence to a frequency probability.  //
Labs_Batch_5: Examples of Machine Learning algorithms to get a Huawei Certification.

Hello, this a change
